# Speeder  
Hello,
This is speeder, a js spaceship game made with the HTML5 <canvas>. You can shoot, travel fast & speed run the levels all while levelling up.

## Requirements
* A resolution of at least 1280 x 720 px
* A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Safari)
* A keyboard & a mouse

## Features
* Fly in a procedural generated level
* Dodge asteroids, pick up xp and go faster using boost
* You can shoot and explode asteroids, but there's a limit
* Generate your own level, try things, careful, it might get buggy ¯\ _(ツ )_/¯
* Turn off & on motion blur
* Turn off & on particles
* Buy new weapons and trail color
* Boost your spaceship !
* The ship rotates while moving !
* there's sound that you can turn off
* The menu stars are shinning (look closely)

## Remarks for correction
I didn't minimize the js/css in order to help the correction, I hope it's okay !
I also added lots of xp so you can test everything ! :D

## Ressources
I used the [Borg typeface](https://www.behance.net/gallery/12578815/Borg-Typeface-(FREE)) and the [Poppins typeface](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/poppins) for this project.

I also used [seedrandom.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedrandom) to generate the levels, made by [David Bau](http://davidbau.com).

## Usage
