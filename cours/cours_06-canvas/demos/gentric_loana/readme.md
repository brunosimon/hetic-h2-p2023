# Animated & Interactive Canvas 

For this project I decided to create a nice "Singer simulator" Christmas edition. 

## Features Presentation 

The face entirely created in canvas can be animated by you with the controlers at the right of the screen. 

You can move the lips/mouth of the girl and make her wink.

By pressing space you will start a song and christmas trees and hat will appear. The music can be paused by repressing the space bar.

By pressing enter a snow fall will occur.
