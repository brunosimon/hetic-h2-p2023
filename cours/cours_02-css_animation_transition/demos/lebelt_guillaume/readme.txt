1_ Theme

The theme of this project is Star Wars , and more precisely a spaceship of the next movie Star Wars.

2_ Presentation

Made in five days , this project combines svg , svg animation , css, css and animation , to create a star wars ship, and its introduction.
It is an HETIC Project, with the following instructions :
Making a HTML file , with his CSS file, with thematic you have chosen yourself.
It must contain animations and / or transitions and transformations (not mandatory 3D).

3_ Features

Introduction in SVG, with stroke animation, and background animation.
Spaceship in Full CSS, animation of the weapon, with a green missile (translateX), clouds (translateX), sun (box-shadow), and the main part with shadow, dust, and spaceship with translateX and translateY.
The main work was the realisation of the spaceship in full css, and animations are just a complement of the project.
There is also a credits navigation, with hover effect in the link, and effect when the menu appear and disappear.

4_ How its works

The project tree are :
Guillaume_LEBELT
	-> index.html (contains all the div's and svg)
	-> scripts
		->jquery.js
		-> navigation.js (contains a little script for animate the credits navigation)
	-> style
		-> normalize.css
		-> main.css (contains all the css of the project)
	-> images
		-> overlay.png (it is used for add some old texture to the project)
	-> readme.txt (all informations about the project)


No necessary dependencies , you just open index.html in a browser.

5_ Ressources

I just use jquery for my menu, and normalize.css to have a good code base.

6_ Problems 

I have some problems on Safari browser, the border-bottom of the main div which contains spaceship, ground, and sky, disappear.
An other problem, in the intro, the svg tends to shake when animating.
